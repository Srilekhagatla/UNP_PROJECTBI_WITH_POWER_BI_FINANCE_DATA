# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCE_DATA
Completed this project as part of my Value added course Mastering BI with PowerBi with United Network of Professionals (UNP).
In this project, I utilized Microsoft Power BI to create an interactive financial data dashboard designed to streamline the analysis and visualization of complex financial metrics. The goal was to provide decision-makers with a powerful tool that not only displayed key performance indicators but also offered a detailed, easily navigable platform for deeper analysis. By incorporating a range of dynamic visualizations, I transformed raw financial data into intuitive, actionable insights that guided strategic business decisions.

The project began by gathering and organizing large datasets from multiple financial sources, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all data points. I then employed Power BIâ€™s robust data modeling capabilities, including DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and Power Query, to clean, transform, and structure the data for optimal performance. This ensured that the dashboard reflected real-time financial performance with precision.
